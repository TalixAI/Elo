This covers how to install the necessary ML libraries and frameworks. We’ll start with TensorFlow and PyTorch. Here’s how you do it:

Installing TensorFlow and PyTorch:

TensorFlow:

pip install tensorflow

PyTorch:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

Installing Other Libraries:

Scikit-learn for traditional ML:

pip install scikit-learn

Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks:

pip install transformers

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation:

pip install pandas numpy

Installing Django/Flask:

We’ll use Flask to create APIs that interact with the models.

Flask:

pip install Flask

Installing Celery:

For task scheduling and distributed processing:

pip install celery
