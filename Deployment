Creating a Dockerfile:

In the root directory of the Elo system project, create a new file named Dockerfile:

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME EloSystem

# Run adaptive_integration_model.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "adaptive_integration_model.py"]

Explanation:

This Dockerfile creates a lightweight Python environment, copies the code into the container, installs the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt, and exposes the application on port 5000.

Creating requirements.txt:

In the root directory, create a requirements.txt file:

numpy
sklearn
flask

Explanation:

requirements.txt lists all Python dependencies that need to be installed in the Docker container.

Building and Running the Docker Container:

Build the Docker container:

docker build -t elo-system .
Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 elo-system

Explanation:

The docker build command creates a Docker image for the Elo system.

The docker run command starts the container, making the system accessible on port 5000.

Deploying the Container:

You can deploy this container to any Docker-compatible environment, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
