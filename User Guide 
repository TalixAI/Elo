### **Customizing Components**

Each component within the Elo System is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the system to your specific needs. This section will guide you through the process of modifying configurations, integrating new models, and scaling the system.

**Customization Overview:**

1. **Foundation Model (FM):** Add or remove neural network modules based on the specific tasks you need to perform.
2. **Orchestrator Model (OM):** Customize resource allocation algorithms to prioritize critical tasks.
3. **Token Management Model (TMM):** Adjust token allocation strategies for different components.
4. **Adaptive Integration Model (AIM):** Integrate new models or change the weighting of existing ones to improve accuracy.
5. **Data Handling and Preprocessing Model (DHPM):** Configure new data sources and preprocessing steps.
6. **Dynamic Memory and Context System (DMCS):** Adjust memory size and context windows for different use cases.
7. **Energy and Resource Management Unit (ERMU):** Fine-tune energy policies to balance performance and efficiency.

### **Integrating New Models**

The Elo System is designed to be extensible, allowing you to integrate new models into the Adaptive Integration Model (AIM) or other components. Here's how you can add a new model:

1. **Develop the Model:**
   - Implement the new model using your preferred machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
   - Ensure that the model's API is compatible with the AIM's interface.

2. **Register the Model in AIM:**
   - Update the AIM configuration to include the new model.

```yaml
models:
  - name: new_model
    path: models/new_model.py
    weight: 0.25
```

3. **Train and Deploy the Model:**
   - Train the new model using the available training data.
   - Deploy the model within the AIM for integration with other models.

### **Scaling the System**

As your usage of the Elo System grows, you may need to scale it to handle increased workloads. This can involve scaling up individual components or the entire system.

**Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy additional instances of components like the Foundation Model or Orchestrator Model to distribute the workload across multiple servers.

**Vertical Scaling:** Increase the computational resources (CPU, memory) allocated to the existing components to improve performance.
